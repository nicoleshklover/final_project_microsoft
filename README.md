# Anomaly Detection Tool

## Introduction

This project focuses on creating an accessible tool for detecting and analyzing anomalies, seasonality and trends within time series data for Microsoftâ€™s Excel for the Web team. The tool is a Python based solution that dynamically generates Grafana dashboards from Kusto Query Language (KQL) inputs.

Given a KQL query representing a time series table, the tool creates a Grafana dashboard with visualizations that allow the exploration of the time series in terms of anomaly detection, trends, and seasonality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Time Series Analysis**: Automatically detect anomalies, trends and seasonality in time series data using KQL functions such as `series_decompose` and `series_decompose_anomalies`.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports various KQL inputs, including filters or specific dimensions.
- **Grafana Integration**: Creates visually appealing and interactive dashboards for comprehensive analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection for issues such as authentication failures.
- **Threshold Tuning**: Allows users to dynamically adjust anomaly thresholds directly in Grafana.

## Key Scripts

### `config.py`

Handles environment variable loading and configuration setup. Key variables include:

- Azure authentication (`APP_ID`, `APP_KEY`, `AUTHORITY_ID`)
- Cluster and database details (`QUERY_CLUSTER`, `DATABASE`)
- Grafana API details (`API_TOKEN`, `GRAFANA_URL`)
- Base KQL query (`BASE_QUERY`)

### `kusto_connection.py`

Manages the connection to ADX and provides helper functions:

- `get_query_client()`: Authenticates and returns a Kusto client.
- `get_all_table_names()`: Retrieves all table names from the specified database.
- `extract_table_name()`: Extracts the table name from a given KQL query.
- `extract_dt()`: Calculates time differences between consecutive rows.

### `anomaly_detection.py`

Generates KQL queries for various analyses:

- `generate_series_decomposition_query`: Decomposes series into trend and seasonal components.
- `generate_series_decompose_anomalies_query`: Detects anomalies based on decomposed components.
- `generate_anomaly_count_per_segment_query`: Summarizes anomalies by dimension.
- `generate_anomaly_count_bar_chart`: Visualizes anomalies for specific dimensions.

### `dashboard.py`

Handles the creation and configuration of Grafana dashboards:

- `create_dashboard`: Sends API requests to Grafana to create dashboards.
- `add_row`: Adds organizational rows to the dashboard layout.

### `main.py`

Orchestrates the entire process:

- Validates configuration.
- Extracts columns and dimensions from the KQL base query.
- Generates Grafana variables and queries.
- Invokes `create_dashboard` to build and deploy the dashboard.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file with the required variables (e.g., Azure credentials, Grafana details).
   - Note: The input query currently has to be ordered: time stamp column, value column, other dimensions.

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Use `pip` to install required libraries, such as `azure-kusto-data` and `requests`.

3. **Run the Tool**:

   - Execute `main.py` to generate the dashboard. Ensure the `.env` file and Python scripts are in the same directory.

4. **Access the Dashboard**:

   - Log in to your Grafana instance and view the newly created dashboard.

## Future Improvements

- **Real Time Alerts**: Enable notifications for detected anomalies.
- **Dynamic Column Detection**: Support tables with varying column arrangements.
- **Enhanced UI**: Develop a graphical interface for configuring inputs and thresholds.
- **Dimension Prioritization**: Automatically filter irrelevant dimensions for better focus.
